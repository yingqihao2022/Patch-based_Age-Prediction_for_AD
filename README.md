## Usage

### 1. Data Preprocessing before training or infernce
    Run preprocess.py with an *nii.gz brain with.
### 2. Inference 
    Run 
    python inference_one_brain.py /path/to/brain_patches 25 --model best_model.pt
    The path here is the output path of step 1.
### 3. Train your own age prediction model.
    Prepare an xlsx file with two columns: ID and Age, then run train.py after preprocessing.
