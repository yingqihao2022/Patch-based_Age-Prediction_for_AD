## Usage

### 1. Data Preprocessing before training or infernce
    Run preprocess.py with a folder containing *.nii.gz files
### 2. Inference 
    Run python inference_simple.py brain.nii.gz 25 --model best_model.pt
### 3. Train your own age prediction model.
    Prepare an xlsx file with two columns: ID and Age, then run train.py
